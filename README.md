## Usage

Use as you normally would an eloquent model or query builder.

See `tests` directory for additional examples

Below is a list of currently untested methods or functionality. This does not mean that they won't work, just that there is currently no test coverage.

- `union`
- `whereJsonContains`
- `whereJsonLength`
- `whereBetween`
- `whereNotBetween`
- `orWhereColumn`
- `whereExists`
- Subquery Where Clauses
- Upserts
- `updateOrInsert`
- Updating JSON Columns `->update(['options->enabled' => true]);`
- `increment` or `decrement`

```php
DB::connection('clickhouse')->insert(
    'analytics',
    ['ts' => time(), 'analytic_id' => mt_rand(1000, 9999), 'status' => mt_rand(200, 599)]
);
        
DB::connection('clickhouse')->table('analytics')->insert([
    'ts'          => time(),
    'analytic_id' => 321,
    'status'      => 204,
]);

DB::connection('clickhouse')
    ->table('analytics')
    ->where('ts', '>', strtotime('-1 day'))
    ->count();
    
class Analytic extends ClickhouseModel
{
    public $guarded = []; // optional, added for brevity
}

Analytic::create(['ts' => time(), 'analytic_id' => mt_rand(1000, 9999), 'status' => 204, 'name' => 'page_view']);

Analytic::where('ts', '>', strtotime('-1 day'))->count();

Analytic::where('name', 'page_view')->update(['name' => 'page_visit']);
```

### Testing

Testing is done within docker to simplify setting up Clickhouse

```bash
composer up <-- starts the docker containers, PHP and ClickHouse
```

Run the tests:

```bash
composer test
```

### Caveats

- the underlying `SeasClick` extension does not support all Clickhouse features
    - it does not support the `Bool` type, a `UInt8` can be used instead
